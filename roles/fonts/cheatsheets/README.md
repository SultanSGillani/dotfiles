# nerd-font-cheatsheets

Generated list of Nerd Font to simplify finding characters that look good in text editors and
terminal prompt.

## Usage

You'll need to pull the repo and open the files in your editor using a Nerd Font-based font.
Looking at the files in the browser will probably look goofy with lots of missing glyphs.
