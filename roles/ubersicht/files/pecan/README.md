# pecan

![Screenshot 3](/screenshots/1.jpg)

A bar for macOS. Reports — by default — the current workspace, network bandwidth, date, battery percentage and time.

## Instructions

*pecan* requires [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).

Once Übersicht is installed, download this repository to wherever your widgets are stored (by default ~/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/).

This can be done via the terminal like so:

```sh
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew cask install ubersicht
git clone https://github.com/zzzeyez/pecan.git "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/pecan"
```

If Übersicht is running, then the bar should appear.

## Customization & Themes

### Load themes

*pecan* includes a tool `pecan-style` to allow users to save and load themes. There are, by default, a few included themes.

```sh
ln -s "${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/pecan/pecan-style" "/usr/local/bin/pecan-style"
```

Then if you want to load the default theme, you do it like so:

```sh
pecan-style --load default
```

For more info on `pecan-style` do:

```sh
pecan-style --help
```

### Create themes

Because *pecan* is styled using CSS3 variables, the top lines of `style.css` can easily be edited to change properties like opacity, alignment, padding, colors and more. If you are using this bar with Wal, then you should be editing `scss/style.scss` instead.

## Optional features

### Ifstat

Current download and upload speeds may be shown in the 2nd-to-left element via *Ifstat*. If *Ifstat* is not found, then the current WiFi network will be displayed instead. To install *Ifstat via* Homebrew:

```sh
brew install ifstat
```

### ChunkWM

Current workspace ID can be shown on the left element if [ChunkWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) (*unmaintained*) is installed, otherwise a power symbol will be shown instead. To install *ChunkWM*:

```sh
brew tap koekeishiya/formulae
brew install chunkwm
```

### xanthia

If *xanthia* is installed then it will now use *pecan*'s CSS/SCSS files. Install [xanthia](https://github.com/zzzeyez/xanthia/blob/master/README.md#Installation).

### Wal

*pecan* can pull a color palette generated by *Wal* using *Sassc*. I have included a script, `wal-set`, that will perform this.
To install *Sassc*:

```sh
brew install sassc
```

Now you can run the script to use Wal's palettes:

```sh
bash "~/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/pecan/wal-set"
```
